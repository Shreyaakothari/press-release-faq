# Ship transfer orders

## Retailers want to use HotWax Commerce Fulfillment and Inventory Management Suite to manage transfer orders between their inventory locations.

Retailers optimize their sales orders fulfillment by leveraging HotWax Commerce Fulfillment Suite, extending its capability to manage transfer orders will eliminate the need for fulfillment teams to use an external system to manage transfers. Additionally, for receiving these shipped transfer orders at the destination location, relying on HotWax Commerce Inventory Management Suite will help ensure precise inventory management.

Companies often need to transfer stock between fulfillment locations, such as from a warehouse to a retail store or between stores. These transfer orders are fulfilled in a way that resembles regular sales orders and are transported by carriers like FedEx and UPS. Using separate systems for handling sales orders and transfer orders requires tracking of pending orders, which could potentially result in errors and oversights. Multiple systems for a fulfillment team also requires additional training, which team members often display reluctance towards. Additionally, to acknowledge received transfer orders at stores, if POS systems lack inventory management capabilities, retailers resort to using blind receipts. In absence of an app or system to scan the transfer order items at the time of receiving, the likelihood of variances between expected and actual inventory counts increases.

HotWax Commerce Inventory Management Suite now allows merchants to seamlessly relocate their inventory between different locations. The Fulfillment App lets merchants leverage the familiar streamlined workflow used for fulfilling sales orders to ship transfer orders. Added flexibility to fulfill sales and transfer orders within a single system also eliminates the need to track orders across multiple systems and greatly simplifies management processes. Effortlessly receiving shipped orders directly from the Receiving App ensures accurate inventory records at each location, especially when in-store native POS systems lack the required inventory management functions.

HotWax Commerce will fetch transfer orders created in any external system. Alternatively, retailers may also create transfer orders directly within HotWax Commerce. The Fulfillment App's interface will be extended to support the fulfillment of transfer orders. Shipped transfer orders will be automatically updated in the Receiving App at the destination location where merchants can receive them.
