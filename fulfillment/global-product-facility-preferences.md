# Global Product Facility Preferences

## Retailers want the ability to configure product fulfillment and pick-up preferences globally in addition to individual facility level.

Global product-facility preferences will help retailers handle product fulfillment and pick-up configurations across all the locations. The ability to have a global toggle for a product to disable online inventory or pickup options massively reduces the amount of manual data maintenance that would otherwise be required to execute the same configurations.

When dealing with a range of products at multiple locations, retailers may need to temporarily halt online sales for a specific product from all the fulfillment centers. Navigating to each facility to disable online sales for a specific product introduces an extra layer of effort and requires constant vigilance to ensure the settings are applied correctly for all facilities. Failing to do so results in overselling and leads to order cancellations. Retailers often have products that are heavy or have special add-ons like personalized jewelry and prescription eyewear, are not viable for pick-up and should only be shipped from warehouses or specially equipped facilities. Disabling pick-up individually for products that arenâ€™t eligible at all stores is a tedious task, especially for retailers with an extensive store network. Not disabling pick-up for even a single facility can result in receiving pick-up orders that ultimately need to be canceled or re-routed, leading to a subpar customer experience. Not having an option to set global product fulfillment and pick-up preferences presents challenges at the business-level and hampers operational efficiency.

The ability to manage product-facility preferences at a global level in addition to granular facility level configurations ensures accurate systemic management. Easily modifying settings for online inventory and pick-up of products at a global level allows retailers to handle configurations in relation to specific products. Having global settings for a product that supersede individual product-facility configurations eliminates discrepancies and helps exercise consistent control which would otherwise require monitoring across all locations.

Retailers that want to manage global product-facility preferences can go to the inventory configuration section from the Find Product page. Within this section, retailers can toggle the Allow Pickup setting to configure if a product is available for pick-up at any location. Similarly, retailers can modify the Sell Online setting to disable online inventory for a specific product.
