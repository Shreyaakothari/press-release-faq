# Product and Facility Configuration Management

## Retailers want the ability to manage their different product facility configurations at scale without resorting to CSV bulk uploads.

Product settings allow for global configurations to be set for a product regardless of the facility. Facility settings enable retailers to customize fulfillment locations for brokering and inventory calculations. Product facility settings provide a granular option for managing specific products' fulfillment configurations on a per-facility basis. Product and facility configuration management offers a centralized dashboard where global settings for products and facilities can be configured. Applying predefined rules based on product tags and facility types or groups will allow retailers to manage unique sets of product facility configurations at scale.

When retailers deal with multiple product assortments and a large number of facilities, they may have unique configurations specific to product classes and locations. However, individually managing product and facility settings at scale becomes overwhelming and modifying existing categories of products or introducing new products across facility groups requires uploading large CSV files. These manual efforts consume a significant amount of time and make it difficult to implement changes dynamically as fulfillment rules evolve.

Product facility configuration management will offer retailers the ability to apply standardized rules based on product tags and facility type or custom groups. Deep customization of product facility workflows enables retailers to implement real-time revisions to their brokering and fulfillment parameters without continuous manual maintenance. An automated rule based approach lets retailers effectively manage their product facility configurations at scale, and tune their fulfillment rules to best suit their product catalog and customer needs.

Retailers using HotWax Commerce can assign specific tags to different product categories, classify facility type or groups and based on that create their product facility rules directly in the Order Management System.
