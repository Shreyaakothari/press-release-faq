# Single sign on across apps

## Users switching between multiple front-end apps to complete a task should not be required to log in again for each app. 

HotWax Commerce Apps Suite provides multiple apps designed to handle specific use-cases, workflows, and business operations. With the Single Sign-On (SSO), once a user logs into one application connected to the OMS, their session will be securely retained. Allowing authenticated users to seamlessly navigate between different front-end apps without the need for repetitive logins creates a seamless user experience when working across multiple apps simultaneously.

When users initially sign in to an app, they input their instance name and unique credentials to gain access. While using the OMS, they often have to navigate between various front-end apps, which requires repeated logins for each app. When functions in one app link to another app, re-authentication is required to access the linked destination. The repetitive login process negatively impacts users' productivity and interrupts the seamless progression between tasks, leading to delays and frustration. The decreased efficiency and loss of focus results in an increased likelihood of making errors. 

Users navigating to other apps in the OMS suite are automatically logged in, without the need to re-enter their credentials. This functionality is made possible by reusing the session created in the browser from the initial login, ensuring a frictionless and uninterrupted user experience for subsequent apps. The ability to leverage deep linking, enabled by single sign on, within the HotWax Commerce Apps Suite lets users directly access another linked app and quickly carry out correlated functions. Eliminating the time-consuming process of logging in to each app individually enables users to access the tools they need quickly and focus on their tasks at hand.

Retailers using HotWax Commerce Apps Suite will already receive the SSO feature.
