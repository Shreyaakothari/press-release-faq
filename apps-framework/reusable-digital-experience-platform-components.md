# Reusable Digital Experience Platform Components

## DXP Components are going to make front end PWA development easier for any developer trying to extend HotWax Commerce.

DXP components are reusable components specifically designed to offer off the shelf functionality for developers so that they donâ€™t have to implement repetitive functionality across a suite of applications. They also help new developers start to form their applications without having to dive into basic boilerplate code that is needed to create context for the experience they want to offer, such as facility selection or Product Store selection.

Traditionally, with monolithic platforms, new application features would only have to be implemented in one application and they would become available throughout all experiences offered by that application. Modern, distributed applications offer great benefits over traditional monolithic applications but come with the downside of having to maintain a consistent experience across a sprawling library of applications. As teams grow in size, subdivisions are also introduced to let individual applications develop in practices that are optimized for it. These divisions then create further deviations from a consistent experience across applications. When time comes to implement a new platform wide user experience, functionality has to be re-implemented for every application that requires it, creating windows for implementation errors and redundant code reviews.

DXP components allow development teams to use pre-package components that have an optional UI layer in their applications to implement common functionality. The components abstract the functional inner workings of the component and present the user with methods to use in their UI along with lifecycle hooks that allow for integration into various use cases within their custom workflows. Often times when a feature just needs to be implemented with the same UI across all or most applications, DXP components also allow developers to simply insert the components HTML tag into their markup which then proceeds to add the entire markup UI code and functional script as well, reducing developer repetition to a bare minimum.
