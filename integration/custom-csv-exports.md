# Custom CSV exports

## Clients want to transform out of the box CSV file exports from HotWax Commerce into formats that align with field mapping requirements of the external system without having to develop custom exports.

HotWax Commerce Apps Suite now allows clients to transform native CSV files produced by HotWax into their custom formats. Additionally, they can also leverage scheduled custom CSV exports to FTP locations where integrated systems can process them.

Each client has unique business scenarios within their ecosystem. Many times they need bulk CSV exports of specifically sequenced data elements with customized headers for external systems. Creating customized bulk exports requires developer intervention and cannot be automated by retailers themselves. Having to rely on customer support to extract data in formats that are consumable by an integrating system is slow, expensive and requires constant maintenance for bugs and paid updates if formats change. Not having this flexibility gives retailers less control over their own technology stack and discourages them from adding other best of breed systems to their technology stack and, by extension, delivering a worse customer experience.

Built-in capability in apps to modify predefined CSV file formats by selecting relevant fields, renaming headers with custom labels, or redefining field sequences enables easy extraction of mapped data required for external systems or reports. Added flexibility to schedule custom CSV exports to FTP locations streamlines data exchange between different applications and systems which otherwise necessitates custom development efforts and system redeployment. Both on-demand and scheduled workflows enhance data interoperability and eliminate the need for developer intervention. This accelerates data transformation, saves time, and ensures a smoother deployment experience.

Custom CSV exports will be added to apps in a phased approach where they are relevant to business operations. All import and export tools will also be centrally accessible from a common Import and Export Management App.
