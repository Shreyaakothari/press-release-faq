# Map Shopify Shipping Methods with Carrier Shipping Methods 

## Retailers should be able to choose if a shipping method in Shopify needs to be rate-shopped or be fulfilled by a predefined carrier of their choice.

Mapping Shopify shipping methods with carrier shipping methods will allow retailers to define their preferred carriers for each shipping method. Easily configuring which Shopify shipping method should be rate-shopped and when to directly assign a particular carrier and shipping method will help retailers fully customize their shipping preferences. Added support to designate external shipping aggregators for rate-shopping will ensure alignment with business-specific needs.

Not allowing retailers to choose carriers for their shipping methods explicitly and forcing rate-shopping creates barriers in multiple fulfillment workflows. Rate-shopping should be disabled for Shopify retailers who have integrated with shipping carriers like Shipssy and ShipT to handle same-day delivery orders, or have partnered with shipping aggregators like Shiphawk, which have their own rate shopping algorithms. Using specific carriers for specific Shopify shipping methods requires developer intervention, which is a rigid and time-consuming experience for retailers. Inflexibility to disable rate-shopping also leads to ineffective shipping practices and difficulty in aligning with retailersâ€™ business needs.

Mapping Shopify shipping methods with carrier shipping methods lets retailers easily configure specific carriers on shipping methods, which otherwise requires added expenses and developer intervention. Explicitly mapping carriers for Shopify shipping methods allows retailers to define the integrated carrier preferences. Selectively rate shopping ensures that only those shipping methods are rate-shopped that do not have a predefined carrier. Additionally, the ability to plug-in other rate-shopping engines allows retailers to use their preferred fulfillment toolkit with their OMS.

Retailers that want to start using this feature will need to connect with HotWax Commerce support to set up a new mapping for Shopify shipping method and carrier shipping method.
