The Job Manager App should let organizations save custom job templates and offer pre-defined templates to facilitate easy auditing of system processes.

Job templates will allow organizations to save a template of the jobs needed for their business, making it easier to audit their actual and expected system operations. Pre-defined templates will also let operation teams simply schedule their preferred template based on specific use cases.

Keeping track of multiple scheduled jobs with different frequencies and run-times tailored to specific business requirements becomes cumbersome and error-prone, especially for larger enterprises. Additionally, when systems need to be re-deployed, it becomes difficult to monitor if all necessary jobs have been scheduled or not. Remembering to enable temporarily disabled jobs and coordinating efforts within a team setting creates additional challenges.

Job templates offer a structure for operational teams to compare their expected job setup with whatâ€™s currently running. If any unexpected discrepancies are found in the scheduled jobs, prompt actions can be taken to rectify them and restore the accurate job configurations. The app's intuitive interface ensures seamless scheduling, monitoring, and deployment of jobs,  regardless of the scale of the enterprise. Default templates in the app will cater to specific use cases that operation teams can use to quickly schedule most suitable automations for their needs.

To start utilizing job templates, operations teams can simply access the Job Manager App and navigate to the templates section. Team members can either create a new custom template by specifying the desired jobs, frequencies, and run-times or choose from the pre-defined templates that align with their needs.
